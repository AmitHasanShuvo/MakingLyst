# MakingLyst

This repository is an extension of our other work as MakingLyst - a chance to peek into the tech and design at Lyst. Or, to put it another way, a chance for us to be transparent about how we work, why we work the way we do and, to give back to the community through sharing of ideas and code.

In here you will find how to's, guides, code snippets and anything else that we find helpful and that we don't need to hide away on our internal Wiki.

We are based in London, England and we welcome your feedback, comments and, yes, pull requests.
